            The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being
            overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and
            sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the
            privilege of owning yourself.

            <p> think it's great to be flawed. I am hugely flawed, and I like it this way. That's the fun of life. You fall, get up, make mistakes, learn from them, be human and be you.</p>

At the end of the day, you put all the work in, and eventually it’ll pay off. It could be in a year, it could be in 30 years. Eventually, your hard work will pay off.”</p>

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”</p>
