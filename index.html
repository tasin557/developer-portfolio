            The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being
            overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and
            sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the
            privilege of owning yourself.

            <p> think it's great to be flawed. I am hugely flawed, and I like it this way. That's the fun of life. You fall, get up, make mistakes, learn from them, be human and be you.</p>
